## Background

This script is created for the KDD and TKDE draft.


## Introduction

Permutation test to calcualte the significance of features in various models, 
such as NB and GWNBR.


## Default Settings

* Region level: CA (we don't consider tract level for now).
* Features of interest: Demo, POI, Geo, Taxi
* Temporal factor is not considered.
