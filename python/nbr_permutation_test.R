# This is the old version of negative binomial regression permutation test.
# The disadvantage of this script is that, each time the newly permuated
# matrix is genrated by Python, and write on local disk. This is silly and
# not efficient.
# 
# Since the permutation relies on the same input f and y, we can permutate
# within this script.
#
# The new permutation implementation is 
# 	``permutation_test.R''
# and This one is renamed as
# 	``nbr_permutation_test.R''
